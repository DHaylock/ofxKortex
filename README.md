# ofxKortex
Node Graph editor for passing signals around in openFrameworks, NOTE this is very early days, nothing works none of the below nodes have been implemeted :) 

# Road Map
Below ive come up with the following nodes that i would like to integrate as a starting point. Basic idea is to have signals that come in, they can be modified in various ways, and then those signals can be plugged into various parameters in your code.

The below road map is what I hope to achieve by the end of 2017. Depending on how things are going phase 2 will look at adding in texture nodes (colour gradients, ofVideoPlayers, ofVideoGrabbers, ofFbo's etc..)
